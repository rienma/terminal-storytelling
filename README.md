# terminal-typed-message-ascii

## Goal

The main idea was to be able to display (the laziest way possible) the story I wrote for some friends within their terminals (Mac and Linux). Entertainment insure by a mix of text and ascii art. 

As summary the goal is to send the folder MESSAGE with really simple instructions.

## Steps

1. Enter into the folder MESSAGE via your terminal
2. python message.py

## More ASCII ?

1. Go to the wonderfull https://www.text-image.com/convert/ascii.html
2. Ascii your pictures and save them into the folder ASCII as text files
3. From the folder Ascii run python ascii_to_list.py
